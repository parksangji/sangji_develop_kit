My project aims to implement user authentication using Spring Security's OAuth2 integration, focusing on Naver, Kakao, and Google login functionalities. Leveraging the OAuth2 protocol, users can seamlessly log in using their Naver, Kakao, or Google credentials, enhancing the authentication process with these popular identity providers. By utilizing Spring Security's robust features, the project ensures secure and reliable user authentication, providing a seamless and standardized login experience. This integration not only simplifies the user onboarding process but also enhances the overall security of the application. Stay tuned for a streamlined and user-friendly authentication mechanism, integrating seamlessly with major social platforms for a more convenient user experience.
